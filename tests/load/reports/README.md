# Load Test Reports

This directory contains load test reports generated by Locust.

## Report Types

- **HTML Reports**: Interactive reports with charts and statistics
- **CSV Reports**: Raw data for further analysis
  - `*_stats.csv`: Request statistics
  - `*_stats_history.csv`: Time-series data
  - `*_failures.csv`: Failure records

## Naming Convention

Reports are named according to the test scenario:

- `baseline_*`: Baseline performance tests (10 users)
- `medium_*`: Medium load tests (50 users)
- `stress_*`: Stress tests (200+ users)
- `cache_test_*`: Cache-specific tests
- `batch_test_*`: Batch processing tests

## Retention

Reports are not tracked by Git (see `.gitignore`).
Keep important reports for reference, but clean up old ones periodically.
